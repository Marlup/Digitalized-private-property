Smart contracts for permanent data traceability and ownership of real-world assets

**Warning**. Project under development.

## Overview
These smart contracts mainly represent an interface to declare the structure of a contract between parties. We can vaguely define a contract as an agreement between more than one, and at least two, parties in solving a matter of interest. The matter of interest is a generalization that can be branched into many specific categories with defined specifications. 

For the sake of illustration, we can think of business and service agreements, the cession of a right of ownership of assets, property contracts, job 
contracts, and informed consent from a health care provider, among many others. In a few words, every aspect which involves differentiated parts that need stipulation and consense on conditions or points relevant to the matter, and impartial verification, can benefit from this project or the extension of it.

Moreover, the logic of the code allows the cession of rights from one or more parties, the cedant/s, to another party, the cessionaries. In other words, the contract can go from having more or less several parties involved, for example, 1 to many, many to 1, or many to many (less or more), and, in consequence, potentially dividing/diffusing or gathering the percentage of ownership of the asset.

To everyone reading this, 

**ANY** improvement or correction will be welcome, no matter the difficulty, simplicity, or silliness. Please, make yourself comfortable about sharing your thoughts because I don't consider myself an expert, but a passionate developer and learner who is willing to bring new ideas and try making them real.

I'd be much obliged if you gave this project a star if you find it insightful.

Thank you.
